## What is the flowmodoro method?
I'm sure you've heard of the Pomodoro method. The flowmodoro method is kind of like that, except without the restriction of a set "end time". Instead of having a set end time, you just work until you start to feel that you're losing focus. Once you feel that, stop working and take a break. Usually, the break is 1/3rd to 1/5th of the time you spent working, and it's spent in doing active relaxation activities(like mindfulness meditation) or in doing some very non-exhausing work(like walking around and thinking of a problem you were trying to solve).

## Why do you need an app?
The app makes the process a lot easier to use. You don't have to do the math on your own, all you have to do is start the stopwatch, stop it when you're tired, and take a break for as long the app tells you to.
